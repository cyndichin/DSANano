# # Permutation

# 
# **Question** - Let's use recursion to help us solve the following permutation problem:
# 
# Given a list of items, the goal is to find all of the permutations of that list. For example,<br>
# Given a list like: `[0, 1, 2]` <br>
# Permutations: `[[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]]` <br><br>
# Notice that the expected output is a list of permutation with each permuted item being represented by a list. Such an object that contains other object is called "compound" object. <br>
# 
# **The Idea**<br>
# Build a compoundList incrementally starting with a blank list, and permute (add) each element of original input list at all possible positions. <br><br>
# 
# For example, take `[0, 1, 2]` as the original input list:<br>
# 
# 1. Start with a blank compoundList `[[]]`. This is actually the last call of recursive function stack. Pick the an element `2` of original input list, making the compoundList as `[[2]]`<br><br>
# 
# 2. Pick next element `1` of original input list, and add this element at position 0, and 1 for each list of previous compoundList. **We will require to create copy of all lists of previous compoundList, and add the new element.** Now, the compoundList will become `[[1, 2], [2, 1]]`.<br><br>
# 
# 3. Pick next element `0` of original input list, and add this element at position 0, 1, and 2 for each list of previous compoundList. Now, the compoundList will become `[[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [0, 2, 1], [2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]]` .<br><br>
# 

# 
# **Additional Resource**<br>
# While dealing with a "compound" object, a simple copy operation might not work as expected. You would need a function that can create a deep copy. For this purpose, you can make use of `deepcopy()` function from the `copy` module in Python. This module provides the function for normal (Shallow) and deep copy operations. Refer here - https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html for syntax and detailed information, that says:  <br>
# <br>
# >**Difference between Deep and Shallow Copy**<br>
# The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or class instances):
#  - A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
#  - A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.
#  
# **Example Illustration of deep copy, shallow copy, and assignment operator**<br>

import copy                                           # `copy` module

list1 = [0, 1, 2]
list2 = [7, 8, 9]                                     
compoundList1 = [list1, list2]                        # create a compound object


'''ASSIGNMENT OPERATION - Points a new reference to the existing object.'''
compoundList2 = compoundList1

# id() - returns the identity of the object passed
print(id(compoundList1) == id(compoundList2))          # True - compoundList2 is the same object as compoundList1
print(id(compoundList1[0]) == id(compoundList2[0]))    # True - compoundList2[0] is the same object as compoundList1[0]


'''SHALLOW COPY'''
compoundList2 = copy.copy(compoundList1)

print(id(compoundList1) == id(compoundList2))          # False - compoundList2 is now a new object
print(id(compoundList1[0]) == id(compoundList2[0]))    # True - compoundList2[0] is the same object as compoundList1[0]


'''DEEP COPY'''
compoundList2 = copy.deepcopy(compoundList1)

print(id(compoundList1) == id(compoundList2))          # False - compoundList2 is now a new object
print(id(compoundList1[0]) == id(compoundList2[0]))    # False - compoundList2[0] is now a new object
